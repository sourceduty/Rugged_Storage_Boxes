This 3D printable rugged storage box insert was designed to be used with external/internal HDDs and external/internal SSDs. This storage box insert has the potential to store 16 x 2.5-inch HDDs or SSDs. In the future, with more data storage innovations, this design can also be used to store 30 or more USB thumb drives and 2 USB hubs. This configurations is a really fast, customizable and easy to use digital file storage method.

### Single and Multi-task Boxes

Single-task storage solutions, where one rugged storage box is designated for a specific electronic project or device, offer significant advantages in organization and efficiency. By allocating a dedicated space for each set of components and tools, users can streamline their workflow, ensuring that everything needed for a particular task is readily accessible. This approach minimizes the time spent searching for items and setting up, which is crucial in environments where precision and speed are paramount. Additionally, such organization aids in protecting sensitive electronic components from being misplaced or damaged.

Conversely, multi-task storage boxes, which house components and tools for various projects, provide flexibility and cost-effectiveness. These boxes allow users to adapt to different tasks without the need for multiple cases, making them ideal for dynamic settings where project requirements can shift frequently. The reduction in the number of cases also saves on costs and space, which can be particularly beneficial in limited workspaces or when transporting equipment to various sites.

The choice between single-task and multi-task storage solutions for electronic projects should be based on the specific needs of the environment and the nature of the tasks. Single-task boxes enhance organizational efficiency and protect components more effectively, making them suitable for settings that require meticulous organization and frequent access to different sets of tools. Multi-task boxes, offering greater flexibility and cost savings, are better suited for situations where project demands are variable and storage space is at a premium. Both approaches have their merits, and selecting the right one depends on balancing the needs for organization, protection, and versatility.

> Alex: *"**Nanuk** makes strong and reliable rugged cases that are great for organizing small electronics and valuables. Fitting a monitor, computer and other parts into these cases for a cyberdeck or retro gaming project is very difficult. Dedicating a case to one specific electronic task is a smarter choice. 3D printing one or more panels to sort the inside of these cases is the best option for organization and longevity. I've used several Nanuk 904 cases because they are the maximum size that can fit on my LulzBot 747 Sidekick 3D printer."*
